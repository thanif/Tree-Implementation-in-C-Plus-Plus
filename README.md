# Tree-Implementation-in-C-plus-plus

Trees are an important data structure used in various applications. This repository first implements (general) trees in C++. Then, uses the tree data structure to load a dataset of weekly sales by various departments in multiple stores owned by a single retail store chain and then uses this tree to answer interesting queries on that data.
